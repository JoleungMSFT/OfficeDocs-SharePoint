# Deploy and configure the new OneDrive sync app for Mac

There are two basic ways that you, as an admin, can deploy the OneDrive sync app to Mac users in your organization:
  
- Have users install and set up the OneDrive sync app themselves by following the instructions in [Sync files with OneDrive on Mac OS X](https://support.office.com/article/d11b9f29-00bb-4172-be39-997da46f913f). To install the OneDrive sync app for Mac, a user has to be administrator on the Mac or know an administrator account name and password. 
    
- Download the installer package file to your local network, and then use your software distribution tools to deploy the app to your users. By using a software distribution tool, you have more control over the deployment, including which users get the sync app and when. The OneDrive sync app for Mac uses the Apple Installer technology for installation. This means you can use the software distribution tools that you normally use to deploy software to Mac users. You can use [Microsoft Intune](/mem/intune/apps/apps-add-office365-macOS). Other common tools are [Jamf Pro](https://www.jamfsoftware.com/products/casper-suite/), [Munki](https://www.munki.org/), and [AutoPkg](https://github.com/autopkg/autopkg). You can also use [Apple Remote Desktop](https://www.apple.com/remotedesktop/) and [AppleScript](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/AppleScript/Conceptual/AppleScriptX/AppleScriptX.html).
  
## Manage OneDrive settings on macOS using property list (Plist) files

After the OneDrive sync app for Mac is installed, users can configure settings for the app. These settings are called preferences. As an admin, you might want to provide users in your organization with a standard set of preferences. Preferences for the OneDrive sync app for Mac are stored in preference files. These files are often referred to as .plist files. 
  
||**Standalone**|**Mac App Store**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|PList Location  <br/> |~/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.OneDrive.plist  <br/> |~/Library/Containers/com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac/Data/Library/Preferences/com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac.plist  <br/> |
|Domain  <br/> |com.microsoft.OneDrive  <br/> |com.microsoft.OneDrive-mac  <br/> | 
  
## Configure sync app settings

Configure the settings on macOS in the typical way:
  
1. Quit the OneDrive application.

2. Define the settings you want to change by creating a Plist with the values, or use a script to set the default values.

3. Deploy the settings onto the local computer.

4. Refresh the preferences cache.

    On the next start of OneDrive, the new settings will be picked up.

## Overview of settings

Use the following keys to preconfigure or change settings for your users. The keys are the same whether you run the standalone or Mac App Store edition of the sync app, but the property list file name and domain name will be different. When you apply the settings, make sure to target the appropriate domain depending on the edition of the sync app.
  
|**Setting**|**Description**|**Parameters**|**Example Plist Entry**|

It also lets you control the deployment of updates. For more info about the update rings and how the sync app checks for updates, see [The OneDrive sync app update process](sync-client-update-process.md).  <br/> |\<key\>Tier\</key\>  <br/> \<string\>(UpdateRing)\</string\>  <br/> |
